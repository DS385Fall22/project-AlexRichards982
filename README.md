# Project

Code is contained in `Elden_Ring_Analysis.ipynb`. I do my best to contextualize the dataset so that people with no knowledge of Elden Ring can understand the information and why it is useful to players. I also include a number of functions to analyze the data.

This repository is public, such that your fellow students can clone the
repository.

## Data

ER - Motion Values and Attack Data (App Ver. 1.08)
